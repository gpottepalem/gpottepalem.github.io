Finally, got my hands on putting this website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and 
I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Thanks to [JONATHAN MCGLONE's](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) step-by-step beginner's guide to creating a personal 
website and blog using Jekyll and hosting it for free using GitHub Pages.

Excited!!!
